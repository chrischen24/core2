        <p>
            This website was created to track the trends between EV and non-EV
            car sales, and CO2 emissions over time. The data that we have collected
            for this graph is based strictly in the United States, and it starts
            from around 2011. We collected data regarding EV car sales, Non-EV car sales (gas cars),
            and CO2 emissions in the United States. We first standardized the units for each data set
            that we were working with in order to have a graph that can accurately (and hopefully) show
            a trend/correlation between these data sets. What we ended up with was this interactive line 
            graph that displays the three data sets that we worked with. When hovering over the graph, 
            you are able to see the exact year and the original units of the data point.
